# SSH - guide:

In this context `SSH` enables you establish remote communication between systems[client and remote host/server]. You can spawn a remote shell in this using `SSH` protocol.

## Prerequisites  

- all your Bash script files must be executable - i.e. do: `$ chmod +x filename`
- the first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`  
- environment:  
> - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  
> - Bash shell  
> - Puppet   

## Steps:  
1. *ask for a server in the intranet* -> select [action] from the [Actions] drop-down menu.

2. **`task 0` - Use a private key**:  
This is a demo on how to connect to your server; no restrictions. Follow the instructions in the task.
Ie you can connect to a remote host like this:  
```bash
# -i option is for specifying the identity file:
ssh -i path/to/file username@server-ip-address
```

3. **`task 1` - Create an SSH key pair**:  
This is how you create an SSH key-pair in command-line:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t type -b bit-length -C "some-identity-eg-machine-or-email"
```

This would take you through a wizard to specify path to file(path and its name - uses default type if you press enter) and then give a passphrase/blank to use none.  
So adapt this to be done using a bash script and specify the passphrase and the filename by passing in options for each respectively.


4. **`task 2` - Client configuration file**:  
This, and subsequent tasks, is the focus of this guide. 
Task specs:  
Your machine has an SSH configuration file for the local SSH client, letâ€™s configure it to our needs so that you can connect to a server without typing a password. Share your SSH client configuration in your answer file.

Requirements:  
    Your SSH client configuration must be configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/school
    Your SSH client configuration must be configured to refuse to authenticate using a password
    Example:

```bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ ssh -v ubuntu@98.98.98.98

```

In the example above, we can see that `SSH` tries to authenticate using school and does not try to authenticate using a password. You can replace 98.98.98.98 by the IP of your server for testing purposes.  

> Well, you have to remember you generated a SSH key-pair in the project: `Bash - Loops, conditions and parsing`. This was a key-pair you generated in `task 0` of that project and you saved it to your intranet profile. It was used to setup your current SSH - Project to enable remote connection to your server.

> If you didn't, then sorry. Maybe you can do now and update in that project section though I think the public key is used to setup the current ssh project. So I'm not sure updating will help, unless the setup is done automatically, as in if there is a detection mechanism that detects file changes in GitHub and adds the key from your GitHub to configure the new project dynamically.

Review these requirements again:

```bash 
    Your SSH client configuration must be configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/school  
    Your SSH client configuration must be configured to refuse to authenticate using a password  
```

> **Note** - focus on the first one:  
> Your key-pair generated in the project `Bash - Loops, conditions and parsing`, should exist in your local machine/sandbox/vm etc.
> If the key-pair you generated in the previous projcet is named `school`, and the path is `~/.ssh/school`, then you're good to go.  
> If not you might have to rename it to `school` ie rename public key, rename private key.  
>> `mv current-name school`  
>> `mv current-name.pub school.pub`  

> move both public key and private key to ~/.ssh/ directory:  
>> `mv school.pub school ~/.ssh/`  


### Configure Local OpenSSH Client:  

You should have a file `~/.ssh/config`  :
```bash
$ ls -a ~/.ssh/
```

If not create it:
```bash
vim ~/.ssh/config
```

Add the content below to whatever is inside if exists:
```bash
Host your-server-ip
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/school
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    PasswordAuthentication no
```

Review this line in the console session above for syntax on how to connect via SSH:  
`sylvain@ubuntu$ ssh -v ubuntu@98.98.98.98`  

`Connect to your server`:  
If you asked for a server in step 1. You have an IP
```bash
ssh -v ubuntu@your-server-ip
```

If you get a `permission denied` error, set the file permission of the `~/.ssh/school` file to read-only for yourself/user:

```bash
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/school
```

```bash
# check if file has read-only permission:
$ ls -l ~/.ssh/school
-r-------- 1 root root 2590 Apr 27 17:45 /root/.ssh/school
```

Ascertain your `SSH` agent is running; else start it in the background and/or add your SSH key to it only if necessary - as in you can try authenticating to server without adding the private key to the agent:  
```bash
# start agent in bg:
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
# do this if necessary:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/school
```

Connect now: 
```bash
ssh -v ubuntu@your-server-ip
```

See shell session below for reference:

5. **Step n: task 3**  

While Still connected to your remote shell.(Review the last part of the console session above)  
Add the string(provided) to the `authorized_keys` file.  

```bash
vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

The SSH public key given in your intranet task 3 looks like this:
```bash
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDNdtrNGtTXe5Tp1EJQop8mOSAuRGLjJ6DW4PqX4wId/Kawz35ESampIqHSOTJmbQ8UlxdJuk0gAXKk3Ncle4safGYqM/VeDK3LN5iAJxf4kcaxNtS3eVxWBE5iF3FbIjOqwxw5Lf5sRa5yXxA8HfWidhbIG5TqKL922hPgsCGABIrXRlfZYeC0FEuPWdr6smOElSVvIXthRWp9cr685KdCI+COxlj1RdVsvIo+zunmLACF9PYdjB2s96Fn0ocD3c5SGLvDOFCyvDojSAOyE70ebIElnskKsDTGwfT4P6jh9OBzTyQEIS2jOaE5RQq4IB4DsMhvbjDSQrP0MdCLgwkN
```

This is the end of the guide.

For task 4; follow the instructions and based on task requirements and your **Puppet** knowledge.

A quick overview:  
You're working on the system-wide SSH configuration file, path: `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`
modify the file `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` using a Puppet script. Use `puppet-lint --fix` if necessary to fix syntax errors e.g. indents

> Disable `PasswordAuthentication` and specify `IdentityFile`.
