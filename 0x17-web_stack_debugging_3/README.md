In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks are assessed. The motivation is to come up with Bash/Puppet scripts that once executed, will bring the webstacks to a working state.

Web stack debugging involves identifying and resolving errors, performance bottlenecks, and misconfigurations in the components that make up a web application's infrastructure. You can get useful info from logs, and shell commands meant to analyze server state, system status, appliaction status etc.

When debugging, sometimes logs are not enough. Either because the software is breaking in a way that was not expected and the error is not being logged, or because logs are not providing enough information. In this context we're figuring out a way to fix `Wordpress`, a very popular tool, which allows you to run blogs, portfolios, e-commerce and company websitesâ€¦ which runs on LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) on a broken Linux Docker container. Wordpress is not running in this case. We will need to go down the stack, find out why Apache is returning a 500 error. Once we find the issue, we fix it and then automate it using Puppet.
