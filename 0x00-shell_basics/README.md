# Shell Basics

This directory focuses on shell scripting using the GNU/Linux Bash language.

## WhAT a Shell IS

The shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by executing commands. It serves as an intermediary between the user and the system's kernel. The shell provides a way to control and manage the computer's resources, execute programs, and manipulate files and directories.

## Basic Functionality

- **Command Execution**: The shell interprets and executes commands entered by the user.
- **Scripting**: It allows the creation of scripts to automate tasks by writing a series of commands.
- **Variable Management**: The shell allows the creation and manipulation of variables to store and retrieve data.
- **Input/Output Redirection**: It provides mechanisms to redirect input and output streams of commands. This will be done in subsequent projects.
- **Pipes**: The shell allows the chaining of multiple commands together using pipes to pass output from one command as input to another.
- **Control Structures**: It supports various control structures like loops and conditional statements to control the flow of execution.
- **File Management**: The shell provides functionality to create, delete, copy, move, and manage files and directories.
