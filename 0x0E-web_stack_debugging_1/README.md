# Web-stack Debugging

> `Series #1`:  
> Builds up on: [0x0D-web_stack_debugging_0](../0x0D-web_stack_debugging_0)

In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks are assessed. The motivation is to come up with Bash scripts that once executed, will bring the webstacks to a working state.

Web stack debugging involves identifying and resolving errors, performance bottlenecks, and misconfigurations in the components that make up a web application's infrastructure. You can get useful info from logs, and shell commands meant to analyze server state, system status, appliaction status etc. In this context, we're figuring out why Nginx is not listening on **port 80**.
