# Web-stack Debugging

> `Series #0`

In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks are assessed. The motivation is to come up with Bash scripts that once executed, will bring the webstacks to a working state.

Web stack debugging involves identifying and resolving errors, performance bottlenecks, and misconfigurations in the components that make up a web application's infrastructure. You can get useful info from logs, and shell commands meant to analyze server state, system status, appliaction status etc.
